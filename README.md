# How to use

1. Download the `.qbtheme` file of your taste. We recommend you download it in a **qBittorrent Themes** folder, but it is not mandatory.
2. Open **qBittorrent**, then go to *Tools -> Options* and click on the box next to *Use custom UI Theme*.
3. Right below that, browse to the path where you previously downloaded the `.qbtheme` file. Click **Apply** and then **OK**.
4. Restart **qBittorrent**. (Close it and then open it again).
